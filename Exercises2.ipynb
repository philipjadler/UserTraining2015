      "2. Smooth pix.fits with a 31x31 boxcar filter (see first tutorial) and make a contour plot at 90, 70, 50, and 30, and 10% of the peak value of the smoothed image.\n",

Extra credit: parroting the readcursor example, write a short callback function to display a cross cut plot of a displayed image on a left mouse button click, and a vertical cut plot on a right button click (overplotting the image). [Hint: this needs use of subplot(111, Frameon=False) to get overplotting on images to work]\n",

Read each of the image extensions in the FITS filele tut3f1.fits using the object-oriented interface, assemble an image cube from the 2-d images in each of the extensions (they are all the same size), and without loops, generate a 2-d result that contains the maximum value at that pixel for the whole stack of images. Display the result. The answer will be obvious if you did it correctly.\n",
      "2. Add the keyword/value pair IMNUM= <extension number> to each of the headers tut3f1.fits right after the TARGET keyword. While you are at it, add a history keyword. Verify the headers have been updated with your favorite FITS header viewing tool (i..e, not PyFITS)\n",
